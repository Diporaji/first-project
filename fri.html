            In the developed nations and even some developing ones, growth and development indices seem to be directly proportional to per-capital consumption of iron and steel prod
            ucts, hence their continued dominance of the production of machinery and equipment to run the major industries of the world. Steel consumption increases when economies are
             growing, as governments invest in infrastructure, trans
            port, and build new factories and houses.In the developed countries, the trend is on consolidation of industry. The focus is on technological improvements and new products.
             A key principle in growth theory is the important roles
            they are considered as being “Engines of Growth” (Kaldor 1996 cited in Bramall 2000). The global steel industry 
            developed from the heavily industrialised Europe and USA.
            Global steel production grew enormously in the 20th century from a mere 28 <br> million tonnes at the beginning of the 20th centur
            <br> to 781 million tonnes at the end. Over the course of the 20th century,<br> production of crude steel has risen at an astounding rate, now
            fast approaching a production level of 1.6 billion tonnes per year.
            Today, it is difficult to imagine a world without steel. During the 20th century, the consumption of steel 
            increased at an average annual rate of 3.3%. In 1900, the USA was producing 37% of the world’s steel. With post war industrial development in Asia, that region now 
            (at the turn of the 21th century) accounts for almost 40%, with Europe (including the former Soviet Union) producing 36% and North America 14.5%.
